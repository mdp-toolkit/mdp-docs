HiNet Planer

written by Niko Wilbert
using several other libraries like jQuery
(see those files for their respective copyright)

This a proof-of-concept program for writing an interactive GUI for mdp.hinet
using modern web technologies like AJAX and SVG. Note that I'm a n00b in these
areas, so there is probably lots of room for improvements.

Run the runme.py file to start the webserver, the frontend should then be
opened automomatically in your browser.
